Redis Sentinel Cache Store for Moodle
=====================================

This is an adaptation of core Redis Cache store of Moodle 4.1 LTS using Redis Sentinel Catalyst code from [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst/moodle-cachestore_redissentinel).

This plugin requires the [PhpRedis](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis) extension.  The PhpRedis extension can be installed via PECL with `pecl install redis`.

Prerequisites
-------------

```bash
# Debian
apt install php-pear php-dev
```

Store configuration
-------------------

**Sentinel Servers**

Comma delimited list of sentinel servers.
It is essential to provide the port number along with IP addresses or hostnames.
(e.g. `10.0.0.1:26379,10.0.0.2:26379,10.0.0.3:26379`, where 26379 is the default TCP listening port by Sentinel)

**Sentinel Group**

Must correspond to the group name of your Sentinel server pool, which is configured individually.
Otherwise the current master node wonâ€²t be able to be determined by issuing the following command:

```bash
redis-cli -h <SENTINEL_SERVER> -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name <SENTINEL_GROUP>
1) "<MASTER_IP>"
2) "6379"

# Where 6379 is the default listening port by Redis
```
